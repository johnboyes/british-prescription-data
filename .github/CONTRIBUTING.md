# How to contribute

## Running the app locally

### Prerequisites

- A [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud) account 
(3 month free trial when you signup)


### Visual Studio Code

The easiest way to set up your development environment (unless you have [Codespaces](#codespaces), which is even easier) is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)'s [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) functionality:
  * [System requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements)
  * Checkout the `british-prescription-data` project if you are a collaborator on the project
  * Or [Fork the project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks) if you are not
  * [Open the local project folder in a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)
  * Everything will then be setup for you.


### Codespaces

If you have access to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces/) (which allows full remote
development from within your browser) then all you need to do is checkout or fork the project and 
[open it in Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) - easy!
